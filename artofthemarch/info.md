# Art of the March

Art of the March is an online archive and interactive presentation of protest signs and posters collected in the aftermath of the historic Boston Women's March on January 21, 2017. This website contains digital images of over 6000 signs placed by protesters on the iron fence of the Boston Commons old Central Burying Grounds and along its perimeter as the march ended. A trio of college professors asked city parks workers, who were prepared to clean the site and trash them, for permission to collect them and volunteers from the public joined in gathering them from the site and loading them into a rented van.
